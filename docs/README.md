# Product Review Analyzer Documentation

Welcome to the Product Review Analyzer documentation. This directory contains comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the Product Review Analyzer system.

## About

The Product Review Analyzer is a powerful AI-driven application designed to help product managers and development teams make data-driven decisions. It analyzes product reviews, user feedback, and GitHub issues to generate actionable insights, identify pain points, extract feature requests, and highlight positive feedback.

This tool leverages advanced AI technologies including Google's Gemini API, Hugging Face Transformers, and natural language processing libraries to provide comprehensive analysis of user sentiment and feedback. With features like real-time data scraping, batch processing, and interactive visualizations, it transforms raw feedback into strategic priorities for product development.
